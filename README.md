# eReader
This is my attempts at making an inexpensive, open source, eReader.  Apart from the high-minded ideals of an open source reader, I also made this because the fact that I still print stuff out on physical paper makes me sad.  There are several versions to choose from, see the comparison chart below to find the one that is right for you!
