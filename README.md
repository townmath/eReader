# eReader
This is my attempts at making an inexpensive, open source, eReader.  Apart from the high-minded ideals of an open source reader, I also made this because the fact that I still print stuff out on physical paper makes me sad.  So far I have made Raspberry Pi versions, but hope to have an Arduino version soon.
